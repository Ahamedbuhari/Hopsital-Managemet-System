# Hospital-Patient Management-System

## Problem Statement:
A hospital needs a robust Patient Management System to efficiently manage patient records, doctor appointments, treatment histories, and hospital performance metrics. The system should enable the storage of electronic health records (EHR), patient demographics, medical diagnoses, treatment histories, and doctor information. Additionally, the system must support the analysis of patient demographics, disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, and hospital performance metrics.

## Solution Overview:
The solution involves designing and implementing a relational database system to store information about patients, doctors, medical records, and treatment details. SQL queries will be used to analyze data, including insights into patient demographics, disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, and hospital performance metrics.

## Database Schema:
Patients: Stores patient demographic data.
Doctors: Stores information about doctors and their specializations.
MedicalRecords: Stores medical records, including admission dates, discharge dates, diagnoses, treatments, and the associated doctor ID.
